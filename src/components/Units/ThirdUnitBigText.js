            <h3 className={'text-title'}>Improving Power Point Presentations</h3>
            <p>The de facto software for most meetings is computer-based presentation software, most commonly Microsoft Power Point. 
                PowerPoint is a powerful tool to assist in communicating ideas and results to an audience. But how can one use this software more effectively and more efficiently?
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in creating a presentation is to decide what the main points are that you wish to communicate and just what you want your audience to remember.
                The next step is to decide what data you will need to show to support those points. The last step is to create the presentation.
                Below are some points for consideration as you prepare for scientific presentations.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Too much information on a slide</h3>
            <p>
            Avoid slides cluttered with too much, or irrelevant information. A title along with three to four rows of information is usually sufficient.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Hard to read fonts</h3>
            <p>
            Stick to fonts that are likely to be found on any computer, such as Arial or Times New Roman. 
            Use bold fonts for emphasis, not for general text. Limit the use of decorative fonts, which are hard to read when projected. 
            Try to limit yourself to two to three fonts during a presentation.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Colour</h3>
            <p>
            Use the Colour/Grayscale button on PowerPoint’s main toolbar to preview a slide in gray tones to see if there is enough contrast without colour.
            Avoid using photos as a background for text except perhaps for title slides.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Overusing bullet lists</h3>
            <p>
            Using only slide after slide of bullet lists will cause your audience to lose interest. 
            When you use bullets, don’t put too much text in them; a single word or two is sufficient to be a cue for the audience and the presenter.
            Try mixing bullet lists with graphics, charts, or other types of slides.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Animations</h3>
            <p>
            Animated graphic images might be fun for some projects, but in a scientific meeting presentation they tend to draw attention to themselves and obscure the message.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Slide transitions</h3>
            <p>
            We suggest using a single subtle transition effect between slides throughout the presentation. 
            Sound effects with transitions tend to distract from the information being presented.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Pointing tools</h3>
            <p>
            Laser pointers are handy for directing attention to items on a slide. 
            Don’t wave a pointer at an object very quickly because it will make it hard for the audience to clearly know what is being emphasized.
            </p>
            <h3 className={'text-title-little'}>Equipment used for presentation</h3>
            <p>
            Arrive at the room early to leave enough time for the moderator to load your presentation onto the computer and to make sure it works properly. 
            Even better, contact moderators ahead of time and provide them with a USB flash drive or perhaps   e-mail the presentation to ensure it will function properly on their equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
            To the extent possible, you also want to know your room layout ahead of time so you can plan how you will move about during your presentation. 
            Consider, for example, using a remote-controlled mouse that enables you to advance your slides without having to be tied to the computer keyboard,
             thus helping you interact more naturally with your audience.
            </p>
            <p>
            Great presentations don’t happen by accident. They require careful planning and preparation. 
            Certainly, the most important element of a successful presentation is the content itself, including how it is organized.
             As we improve our use of presentation software, the quality of our scientific meetings will also improve.
